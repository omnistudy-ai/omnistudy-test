# OmniStudy Project - Google Developer Students Club

## About The Project
During this semester, we will be utilizing Google and other third-party technologies to build a state of the art AI study, learning, and education tracking platform. We will develop this project as a web application open to all to make studying and learning in academic settings easier, more efficient, and overall more exciting.

## How To Run
Pre-requisites: node.js and npm installed on your machine.
1. Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/omnistudy-ai/omnistudy-test.git
    ```

2. Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Note: only the frontend UI is available to run. The code for the server needs to run on a Google Cloud VM and is IP-dependent. You can find the code for the server in the `gc-server` folder.
3. Run the frontend application, at the root of the folder run:
    ```sh
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

You should now be able to open `localhost:3000` in your browser and see the application running.
